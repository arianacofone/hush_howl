Every new endeavor needs a sign up page to funnel all of the buzz. This simple fullstack app allows people to sign up for the new project with a simple click of a button. View it live <a href="https://hush-howl.herokuapp.com/">here!</a>

## Built With
* React
* Express
* Node.js
* PostgreSQL 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Future Variations
The goal of this simple splash page was to reiterate the functionality of each component in a fullstack app. For version 2.0, I'll be creating an authorization page that will allow it's owner to view the registrations, edit/delete entries, and be able to send out a mass email when the project is launched.
